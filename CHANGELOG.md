# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## 0.2.1 — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Sandbox hardening on by default** — `sandbox_user` now defaults to `"agent"` (was `None`/root). Blocks conftest-hook and answer-lookup exploit patterns.
- **Path lockdown** — new `sandbox_locked_paths` parameter makes `/solution` and `/tests` read-only before the verifier runs, blocking `.pth`-injection and similar pre-verify tampering.
- **Verifier failure isolation** — agent errors and verifier errors are now stored separately; a crashing verifier no longer masks the agent result.
- **`labs/benchjack-sandbox-hardening`** — cookbook demonstrating three exploit patterns (P1 conftest-hook, P2 answer-lookup, P7 `.pth`-injection) and their defenses.

### Fixed

- **Oracle runs as `sandbox_user`** — oracle agent now respects path lockdown instead of running as root and bypassing it.
- **Multi-endpoint provider routing** — providers with multiple endpoints now route by the agent's native API protocol.
- **Stale API key shadowing subscription auth** — emits a warning when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var is present alongside `claude login` credentials.
- **pytest `ini`-injection bypass** — closed a verifier hardening edge case.

### Changed

- Version is now single-sourced via `importlib.metadata`; no more duplicate version string in `__init__.py`.
- **User-facing docs** — new `docs/` directory with getting-started guide, CLI reference, architecture overview, task-authoring guide, and labs index. README trimmed; detailed content moved to `docs/`.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-09

**First public release.** A near-complete rearchitecture from the 0.1.x era. API surface has changed — assume breaking changes. Future releases will maintain compatibility within the 0.2.x line. 0.1.x users should treat this as a fresh install; see `.dev-docs/sdk-reference.md` for the new SDK.

### Added

- **Multi-agent, multi-provider, multi-auth matrix** — one YAML config, any supported agent × model × provider × auth combination.
- **Subscription auth support** — use `claude login`, `codex --login`, `gemini` OAuth credentials directly. No API keys required for host-based agent workflows.
- **Vertex AI support** — ADC auth for `google-vertex/`, `anthropic-vertex/`, `vertex-zai/` prefixed models.
- **Provider registry** — add a new LLM endpoint via a dict entry in `providers.py`, no code changes.
- **`benchmarks/` directory** with reusable YAML configs and runner scripts for TB2 and SkillsBench.
- **Auto task download** via `ensure_tasks()` — `terminal-bench-2` and `skillsbench` clone into `.ref/` on first run.
- **`benchflow tasks init`** — scaffold new tasks.
- **`benchflow tasks check`** — validate task structure.
- **`benchflow cleanup`** — delete old sandboxes with `--max-age` filtering (default 24h).
- **Oracle agent support** — run `solution/solve.sh` directly for task validation.
- **Hello-world-task example** for sanity-testing the agent pipeline.
- **Model generation params** via env vars (`BENCHFLOW_TEMPERATURE`, `BENCHFLOW_TOP_P`, `BENCHFLOW_MAX_TOKENS`).
- **OpenClaw ACP shim** with trajectory parsing and skills support.
- **ACP trajectory capture** — full multi-turn agent trajectories via ACP protocol.

### Changed

- **Skill loading** — agent-targeted with proper precedence; auto-distributed from `task.toml` `skills_dir`.
- **`openclaw-gemini` merged** into `openclaw` — provider mode selected at runtime via `BENCHFLOW_PROVIDER_NAME`.

### Fixed

- **API keys leaking in `ps aux`** — env vars now written inside the container instead of passed via Docker exec `-e`.
- **Subscription auth skipped without `-m`** — `benchflow run` without `--model` now checks correctly.
- **ADC credentials break with `sandbox_user`** (#111) — credentials written to sandbox user's home instead of `/root/`.
- **Daytona sandboxes not cleaned up** (#102) — auto-delete after max age.
- **`benchflow cleanup` ignoring `--max-age`** — was deleting everything regardless of age.
- **readline buffer overflow crashes trial** (#98).
- **OpenClaw ACP shim loses tool command text** (#96).
- **OpenClaw ACP shim hardcodes `anthropic/` prefix** (#95) — now routes correctly for Gemini/GLM models.
- **Oracle agent `PermissionError`** writing `agent/oracle.txt` (#91).
- **Oracle path skips `pre_agent_hooks`** (#92) — services now start before oracle runs.
- **Trial data parity with Harbor** (#90) — richer `result.json`, agent logs, per-phase timing.
- **`SDK.run()` `PermissionError`** — `jobs_dir` subdirectories created as root (#88).
- **Partial trajectory lost on timeout** — saved before timeout raises.
- **Redundant `--version` binary check** removed — was wasting 30s per trial.
- **Trajectory fallback** — scrapes agent-native files when ACP `session/update` is empty (#94).
- **`litellm` upgraded to 1.83.0** for CVE-2026-35030; transitive dep security alerts resolved (13 Dependabot alerts closed).

### Deprecated

- `BaseAgent` re-export — planned removal in 0.3.0
- `Trial` re-export — planned removal in 0.3.0
