# VibeArena Benchmark

This is a new benchmark inspired by many vibe coders.

## Overview

VibeArena is an arena-style benchmark that evaluates AI coding performance across different frameworks and model versions. The benchmark focuses on how AI models perform with various libraries and framework versions, providing insights into which models work best with specific tech stacks.

## Key Features

- **Voting System**: Users compare two AI-generated solutions for the same task and vote for the better one
- **Framework Comparisons**: Tests how models perform with different versions of frameworks (e.g., Next.js 14 vs 15)
- **Library Choices**: Evaluates AI performance with different libraries (Tailwind vs alternatives, component libraries, ORMs)
- **Model Cutoff Analysis**: Examines how AI performance changes based on training data cutoff dates

## Live Demo

The benchmark is live at [vibe.benchflow.ai](https://vibe.benchflow.ai)

## Purpose

This benchmark aims to provide practical insights into which AI models produce the best code for specific libraries and frameworks, helping developers choose the right AI assistant for their tech stack.
